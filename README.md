"Unlock Your Potential, One Movement at a Time."

INTRODUCTION

Our goal is to create a virtual reality software that can have an endless amount of real world applications. Ranging from aiding in the medical field, as a physiotherapy aid, as well functioning as a test environment for not only new technologies but also a practice space for companies to have their trainees familiarize themselves with their tools and technologies before going hands on with the real thing.
