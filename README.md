"Unlock Your Potential, One Movement at a Time."

INTRODUCTION

Our goal will be to create a self help app that will allow users with several aspects of their lives, such as help completing daily tasks 
and even more complex things such as VR environments that will serve
as therapeutic tools for both mental and motor function recovery
treatment. We aim to help people that may be dealing with conditions
that may be affecting their day-to-day lives, like ADHD or just stress
by giving them access to easy to use wellness tools that will allow them
to regain control of their lives.
